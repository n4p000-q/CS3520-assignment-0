# Designig a 2-bit binadry adder

This assignment/project involves the design, simulation and testing of a 2-bit binary adder circuit using basic digital logic gates. The circuit is designed to add two 2-bit binary numbers and produce a 3-bit output, including a carry-out bit.

The goal of this assignment is to asses our understanding of digital logic design principles, our ability to create a functional digital circuit, and our skills in using modern collaboration and publishing platforms
