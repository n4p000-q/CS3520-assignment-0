# CS3520 Assignment 0
# Designing a 2-bit binadry adder

This assignment/project involves the design, simulation and testing of a 2-bit binary adder circuit using basic digital logic gates. The circuit is designed to add two 2-bit binary numbers and produce a 3-bit output, including a carry-out bit.

## Repository Structure

- `2-bit Adder(CS3520-assignment 0).dwm` - Contains the circuit schematic diagram and Logisim files.
- `Circuit Test Cases/` - Includes screenshots used in the documentation.
- `report.docx` & `report.md` - Contain the detailed published report.
- `README.md` - Overview of the project and guidance on how to use the repository.

## How to Use
1. Use Digital-Works to open the `.dwm` file to view and simulate the circuit.
